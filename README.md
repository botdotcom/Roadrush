# Roadrush1
My first repository on GitHub. My ESDL project on traffic updates on the go!

Roadrush is the name of the app that me and my group are developing as a part of our Employability Skills Development Laboratory (ESDL) mini-project. The idea of the project is to build an app which will give information about the latest problems that arise on roads. We intend to provide a totally user-supported database platform, and have not tied-up with any organisation like Traffic Police etc.

Only web back-end and front-end files are committed to git.
